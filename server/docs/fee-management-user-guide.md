├── Before software updates
└── ONLY when system is in "critical" state
```

#### **Safety First Approach:**

```
Reconciliation Best Practices:
├── Always run health check first
├── Schedule during low-usage hours
├── Have backup plan ready
├── Test on single classroom first (if possible)
├── Keep detailed logs for rollback
└── Notify stakeholders of maintenance window
```

├── Development Fees: 15-20% for programs/facilities
├── Administrative: 10-15% for operations
└── Special Programs: 5-10% for electives/sports
```

#### 2. **Inflation Adjustment Schedule**

└── August: Monitor initial payment rates
```

#### 3. **Transparent Fee Communication**

```
Parent Fee Information Package:
├── Grade-appropriate pricing breakdown

#### Issue: Student Showing No Fees

```
Symptoms: Student's fee list appears empty
Possible Causes:
├── Student not assigned to classroom correctly
├── Fee structure not created for classroom/term
└── Student record corrupted during import

Solutions:
├── Verify classroom assignment in student profile
├── Check if relevant fee structures exist
